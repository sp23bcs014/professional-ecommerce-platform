## Option 3: Web Hosting Email ($0 - if you have hosting)

If you have business web hosting, they usually provide email services:

```

**Ask your hosting provider for SMTP settings**

## My Recommendation:

**For professional businesses**: Option 2 (SendGrid)
**For small/personal businesses**: Option 1 (Business Gmail)
**If you have web hosting**: Option 3 (Hosting Email)

## What I Need From You:

**Option 1**: App password (16 characters) + business email
**Option 2**: Just your business domain - I'll handle setup
**Option 3**: SMTP settings from your hosting provider

**No personal passwords required! Everything stays secure and professional.**
